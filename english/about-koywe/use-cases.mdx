Did you know money is older than writing? We know this because the first
writings talk about... money! Not money in the way we think of it now, but money
nontheless. Money is a fundamentally human concept, we cannot conceive reality
without it. We're currently going through a paradigm shift when it comes to
money and we believe blockchains will play an important role in this process!

At Koywe, we want to be the tubes and cables that power models that are
generating value, through blockchains. Here are some examples.

### New to Crypto? No worries!

Very few people have their own wallets or have directly interacted with smart
contracts or [DeFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized%5Ffinance)
protocols. This makes for a large obstacle for crypto projects to gain traction
and be embraced, especially in Latinamerica.

With Koywe's APIs and Widgets, crypto projects can offer their services to
anyone in Latinamerica, without them having to have been involved with crypto
before. Your users can easily interact with your protocols or contracts, without
them even knowing there's crypto underneath.

Tokenize real assets, sell art or nature conservation NFTs, offer tools to make
up for carbon emissions, investment accounts, or
[universal basic income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal%5Fbasic%5Fincome)
protocols, all in your local currency!

Koywe will transform your pesos or soles into ETH or USDC so you can keep
focusing on building your web3 project.

<sub>Crypto without all that's hard about crypto.</sub>

### Clients all over Latinamerica

Do you sell products or services in Latinamerica? Have you ever dreamed of
selling in countries other than your own?

At Koywe we help you quickly reach other markets, without having to worry about
creating companies or bank accounts in other countries. Your clients can pay in
their own currency, at the most convenient prices, and we make sure you get
these funds wherever you want.
