### 1\. Choose the currency you want to pay with and the cryptocurrency you wish to receive

![](/images/purchasing-process-1.png)

The first step is selecting the currencies you want to exchange. In this
example, we'll be paying with Chilean pesos (CLP) and receiving Ether on the
Ethereum (ETH) network.

<Warning>
  The currency you pick at this point will determine how you validate your ID
  later on. According to each country's regulations, we might need to ask for
  more (or less) info.
</Warning>

### 2\. Pick an amount to pay or receive

Here, you can choose the amount you'll be paying in your currency of choice or
the amount you'll be receiving in cryptocurrency.

If you choose a local currency, for example 100,000 CLP, our API will calculate
how many tokens you'll get, minus commission.

If you choose an amount in crypto, our API will calculate how much you'll have
to pay, with commission, to get that amount of tokens.

<Info>
  At any point, you'll be able to see how much you're paying and how much you're
  getting, as well as all commission details when clicking **Details**.

### 3\. Enter your Crypto Wallet Address

The next step is to enter the address of your crypto wallet. Our interface will
check if it's a valid address, according to the blockchain of your selected
token.

<Info>
  You can enter an ENS domain name, in Ethereum compatible networks, or connect
  your browser wallet, so you don't have to write the address by hand.
</Info>

### 4\. Verify your email

At Koywe we don't use passwords to log in and siging up isn't necessary to use
our service. You only need to write in your email so we can send you a 6 digit
verification code to log in.

You'll have 5 minutes to enter the code, or you'll have to click on Resend Code.

Once you're finished, you'll be logged in on your browser for 12 hours.

If after 1 minute's wait you still haven't gotten our email, click on Resend
Code. Sometimes our robots are distracted and they forget to send the codes.

### 5\. Verify your identity

If it's the first time you're using Koywe or it's been longer than six months
since your last identity verification, you'll need to verify it again. It's
easy!

#### 5.1 Select your country

Select your country if it hasn't been automatically detected.

#### 5.2 Select a document

You can choose between your passport, identity card, or driver's license, and
then upload a photo of both sides of your document. Make sure there's no glare
to the photograph and that all text is legible so our robots don't get dizzy.

<Info>
  At any time you can click on the Continue Verification on your Phone and take
  pictures more easily. The system will give you a QR code to make it easier.
</Info>

#### 5.3 Selfie Video

The last step is a selfie video! Through it, we can verify you're the person on
the ID provided.

Done! You've successfully completed the steps to verify your identity!

#### 5.4 \[Optional\] Other Info

In some cases, to comply with local regulations, we'll ask you for additional
info, like your address or other personal information.

#### Privacy

Your data is protected by our privacy policy and we only ask for information to
comply with existing regulation. We will not use them for advertisement.

<Info>
Sometimes our robots might take a little while verifying your identity or there
might be an issue with the information provided. If it's been too long and you
haven't heard from us, get in touch.

payment options. Select the one that best suits you and follow the instructions.

app or website using the information given on our interface and email us proof
of transfer.

Our system will adjust commissions according to the payment method you choose.

Don't forget to accept our Terms and Conditions and our Privacy Policy.

### 7\. \[Optional\] Track your transaction

minutes you'll get your crypto! You can track your order through the menu on the
right.
