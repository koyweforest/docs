If you still haven't seen our demo video (less than two minutes), you can watch
it at the end of this page or on the main section
[_What is Koywe?_](/english/about-koywe/what-is-koywe)

### 1\. Choose the currency you want to pay with and the cryptocurrency you wish to receive

  </div>
</Frame>

The first step is selecting the currencies you want to exchange. In this
example, we'll be paying with Chilean pesos (CLP) and receiving Ether on the
Ethereum (ETH) network.

<Warning>
  The currency you pick at this point will determine how you validate your ID
  later on. According to each country's regulations, we might need to ask for
  more (or less) info.
</Warning>

### 2\. Pick an amount to pay or receive

  </div>
</Frame>

Here, you can choose the amount you'll be paying in your currency of choice or
the amount you'll be receiving in cryptocurrency.

If you choose a local currency, for example 100,000 CLP, our API will calculate
how many tokens you'll get, minus commission.

If you choose an amount in crypto, our API will calculate how much you'll have
to pay, with commission, to get that amount of tokens.

<Info>
  At any point, you'll be able to see how much you're paying and how much you're
  getting, as well as all commission details when clicking **Details**.

### 3\. Enter your Crypto Wallet Address

The next step is to enter the address of your crypto wallet. Our interface will
check if it's a valid address, according to the blockchain of your selected
token.

<Info>
  You can enter an ENS domain name, in Ethereum compatible networks, or connect
  your browser wallet, so you don't have to write the address by hand.
</Info>

### 4\. Validate your identity

To validate your identity, you can check the steps in the ["User's validation"](/english/about-koywe/what-is-koywe/user-validation) section.

### 5\. Confirm your order and payment method

If it's the first time you're using Koywe or it's been longer than six months
since your last identity verification, you'll need to verify it again. It's
easy!

<Info>
  Remember: if you choose bank transfer, you have to make a deposit on your
  bank's app or website using the information given on our interface and email
  us proof of transfer.
</Info>

Our system will adjust commissions according to the payment method you choose.

Don't forget to accept our Terms and Conditions and our Privacy Policy.

### 6\. \[Optional\] Track your transaction

Once your payment has gone through, you don't need to do anything else. In just
minutes you'll get your crypto! You can track your order through the menu on the
right.

<Info>
  Once your transaction has been sent over to the blockchain, you can track it
  with your favorite block browser.
