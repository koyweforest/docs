## 1. Verify your email

At Koywe we don't use passwords to login and registration is not necessary to use our service. Just input your email so we can send a 6 digit verification code to log in.

You'll have 5 minutes to enter the code, or you'll have to click on Resend Code.

<Frame>
  <div className="flex space-x-2">
    <img src="/images/user-validation-1.png" />
    <img src="/images/user-validation-2.png" />
  </div>
</Frame>

Once you're finished, you'll be logged in on your browser for 12 hours.

<Tip>
  If after 1 minute you still haven't gotten our email, click on Resend Code.
  Sometimes our robots are distracted and they forget to send them.
</Tip>

## 2. Verify your identity

If it's the first time you're using Koywe or it's been longer than six months since your last identity verification, you'll need to do a re-verification. It's easy!

### 2.1 Select your country

Select your country if it hasn't been automatically detected.

  <div className="flex space-x-2">

    <img src="/images/user-validation-4.png" />
  </div>
</Frame>

### 2.2 Select a document

You can choose between your passport, identity card, or driver's license, and then upload a photo of both sides of your document. Make sure there's no glare on the photograph and that all text is legible so our robots don't get dizzy.

<Frame>
  <div className="flex space-x-2">
    <img src="/images/user-validation-5.png" />
    <img src="/images/user-validation-6.png" />
  </div>
</Frame>

<br />

<Tip>
  At any time you can click on the Continue Verification on your Phone and take
  pictures more easily. The system will give you a QR code to make this easier.

### 2.3 Selfie Video

The last step is a selfie video! Through it, we can verify you're the person on the provided ID.

<Frame>
  <div className="flex space-x-2">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/mintlify/image/upload/v1688001060/spaces_hNbXnOCmSSRtQh1jZYdz_uploads_7I052t8H1Ki19GbnYYir_Dec-07-2022_22-36-21_nub1qz.webp" />
    <img className="w-80" src="/images/user-validation-8.png" />
  </div>
</Frame>

Done! You've successfully completed the steps to verify your identity!

### 2.4 [Optional] Other Info

In some cases, to comply with local regulations, we'll ask you for additional info, like your address or other personal information.

### Privacy

Your data is protected by our privacy policy and we only ask for information to comply with existing regulation. We will not use them for advertisement.

<Tip>
  Sometimes our robots might take a little while verifying your identity or
  there might be an issue with the information provided. If it's been too long
  and you haven't heard from us, get in touch.
