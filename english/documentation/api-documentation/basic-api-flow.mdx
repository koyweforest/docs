### `/accounts`

This service is only for customers who have delegated KYC. <br />
The account to create or update will be based on the email provided in the request. This can be done from the body or through the token. If they are sent from both sides, they must be the same. <br />

### `/Auth`

First, you need to authenticate. For this, you have two ways:

- Directly, if you are already a client, you can do it with a secret and the clientId using the `POST /auth` service. We suggest adding the user's email to use the JWT in the following calls.
- Only available for customers with non-delegated KYC. In a two-step process, through email by consuming the `POST /auth/validate` endpoint. We will send you a code to validate it and then confirm it with `POST /auth/code`.

### `GetCurrencyTokens (on ramp) GetTokenCurrency (off ramp)`

Returns the list of pairs to check available currencies and tokens and display them to the user.

### `/payment-providers` for on ramp

<b>On ramp</b>: Returns the list of available payment methods. In this endpoint,
you will find the transfer data for each country, so it might be a good time to
show them to the user if they select that payment method.

<b>Off ramp</b>: It is not required.

### `/bank-accounts`

Bank account registration.

<b>On ramp</b>: Required only if using the STP payment method.

<b>Off ramp</b>: Required. Before being able to [create an
order](/english/documentation/api-documentation/basic-api-flow#post-orders), we
need to register the bank account where the money will be sent.

### `Post /quotes`

Having the inputs for both fiat and crypto, the user must input the amount he desires to pay or receive in order to obtain a `quote`. Once the call's response is retrieved, the user will be able to know exactly how much they'll pay in fees and how much they'll receive. Optionally, we can ask the API to keep the quote valid for a few of seconds. If that is the case, `quoteId` can be kept to use in the next step.

<b>Test it!</b>
```bash Request
  curl --location --request POST 'https://api.koywe.com/rest/quotes' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
      "amountIn": 1000,
      "symbolIn": "USDC Polygon",
      "symbolOut": "CLP",
      "executable": false
  }'
```

By adding an authentication JWT in the header and `executable: true` to the request, you will get a `quoteId` that can be used to create the order in the next step. This quote lasts for 5 minutes.

### `Post /orders`

Confirming the order is enough. If the `quoteId` is still valid, the only additional parameters are the wallet address or bank account details, the user's `documentNumber`, and, optionally, a metadata field to identify the order on your system.

<Tip>
  For off ramps, you will need to create a bank account for the user. Check the
  docs to see how to do this. The `bankAccount` `id` should be added to the
  `destinationAddress` field.
</Tip>

<b>Test it!</b>
```bash Request
  curl --location --request POST 'https://api.koywe.com/rest/orders' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer superJWT' \
  --data-raw '{
      "quoteId": "64c9a26af1fada33f2e9e5d7",
      "destinationAddress": "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045",
      "metadata": "Sending some USDC to Vitalik",
      "documentNumber": "111243235"
  }'
```

The API will return an `orderId`, the payment details (a url to redirect your user to or the wire transfer details), and information for you to follow up the process. It should look something like this:

```JSON
{
  "data": {
    "createOrder": {
      "amountIn": 822000,
      "amountOut": 1000,
      "documentNumber": "111243235",
      "email": "email@domain.com",
      "metadata": "Sending some USDC to Vitalik",
      "orderId": "27d1a1c0-ff5e-4d5a-8893-a3ac2bb121e7",
      "providedAction": "https://url.to/some-path", // This should be a URL to a payment method or the callback you provided
      "providedAddress": "Koywe SpA\nCta Cte 6824645\n76.215.256-2\nBanco Santander\ntef@koywe.com", // where to transfer the money, in case of wire
      "symbolIn": "CLP",
      "symbolOut": "USDC"
    }
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  If the quote has expired, a new one can be generated `(required from November
  1, 2023)` or make a call to `createOrder` with the same parameters to obtain a
  quote and a order at the same time.
</Tip>

Once the `orderId` is received you can save it, associating it to the user.

The only thing left to do is to wait for the calls to your from our API or check every now and then with `Get /order` providing the `orderId`.

<Info>
  For off-ramp operations in Argentina, they are generally effective
  immediately. However, the status of the order will not change to delivered
  until 4 days have passed since the corresponding cryptocurrencies for the
  created order were deposited.
