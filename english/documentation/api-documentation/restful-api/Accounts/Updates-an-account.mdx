**Updating Email or Document:**

If an updated email is present, the API validates whether it is a valid email and ensures that another account with that email does not already exist.

If an updated document number or type is present, the API validates that it has a valid format, does not exist on another account, has no executed orders,
and initiates an asynchronous validation for mismatching personal data.

The results of the asynchronous validation will be sent to the configured callback. You can find more information in [the webhooks section](/english/documentation/webhooks-and-callbacks#webhooks-document-number-update).
