**For getting supported banks in Colombia:**

It's necessary to include the payoutMethodId. This ID represents the payout provider (https://docs.koywe.com/english/documentation/api-documentation/restful-api/Payout-provider/Returns-a-list-of-available-payout-providers-for-a-given-currency).

**Additional indication:** You can obtain the payout provider specific to Colombia by querying for the currency to be used, in this case COP.
