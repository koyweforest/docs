title: Testing API Limitations
---

### On ramp Payment Methods and limits

Some payment methods restrict the amount of fiat you can use on testing environments (for Khipu it's around 50 USD maximum, for Palomma it's around 1.25 USD minimum, in the local currencies).
We recommend testing with less than 50 dollars or the equivalent amount in local currency to prevent errors.

You will also notice the amount limits are different on the testing API. Whereas in production you will see a
minimum amount of around 25 USD and a maximum of 8,000 USD, the testing API will allow lower and higher amounts.

### Testnet tokens and prices

Some tokens avaialable in production are NOT available on the some of the testnets. For example, USDT is not
available on Polygon testnets, and thus will not be available on our testing API. However, it will available on production.

Additionally, you might encounter prices that are off market or pairs that are not available.

### How we use the Testing API

When we do our testing, we usually start with an on ramp to get the test tokens we'll need to do an off ramp.

1. We create users using `accounts` for each of the countries we want to test.
2. For each user and country, we create JWT session tokens using the authentication endpoint.
3. We create executable quotes for the tokens we want to test. We always choose payment methods that have testing capabilities, like Khipu or Palomma.
4. With the quote, we test if the duration is sufficient for users to confirm the order.
5. If the quote is still valid, we create an order using it, making sure we pass the right wallet address on the `providedAddress` field.
6. We follow the link returned by the API to pay the order.
7. We follow through the payment steps of each payment method. Usually, the passwords or codes are either `1234` or `123456` or are stated on the screen.
8. We wait for the webhooks and blockchain confirmations, occasionally querying the orders endpoint to check the status.

After receiving test tokens, we can try out the off ramps:

1. We create a bank account for each user.
2. We get an executable quote for an off ramp. The only difference is switching the order of the symbols. For on ramps, `symbolOut` will be a crypto symbol; for off ramps it will be a fiat symbol.
3. Passing the `bankAccount` id in the `providedAddress` field, we create an off ramp order.
4. The API returns a wallet address to which we send the exact amount we ordered.
5. We wait for the webhooks and blockchain confirmations, occasionally querying the orders endpoint to check the status.

For off ramps, once we have confirmed the testnet crypto payment, we always simulate a successful bank transaction. To add more real world conditions, we're working on simulating failed transfers.

### OffRamp in Argentina

In Argentina, in order to make the corresponding transfer, bank accounts will be validated to ensure they are not blocked or inactive, and that the bank account holder matches the user who is operating the account.
To do this, we have a batch of specific data.

```
Account Number                    Document
0000242600000000009120            34770518
0000362700000000000116            14013056
0000389400000000000055            25715125
4310001322000000000846            11270545
4310001342400000011259            30890437      // Inactive bank account
```

The operation procedure is as follows:

1. We must have a user account with any document mentioned above.
2. Create a bank account [POST /bank-accounts](/english/documentation/api-documentation/restful-api/Banks/creates-bank-account).
   We will use the corresponding bank account number for the document of the previously created user account.
   Example for a user account with document number: 34770518

```
{
  "countryCode": "ARG",
  "currencySymbol": "ARS",
  "accountNumber": "0000242600000000009120",
  "email": "example@mail.com"
}
```

3. If everything is fine, the bank account will be verified and can be operated through it. Otherwise, the bank account will be invalid for that user account.
4. Create the quote [POST /quotes](/english/documentation/api-documentation/restful-api/Quotes/creates-a-purchase-or-sale-quote).
5. Create the order [POST /orders](/english/documentation/api-documentation/restful-api/Orders/creates-order).
