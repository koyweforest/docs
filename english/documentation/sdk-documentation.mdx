<Tip>
  **See it in action:** You can see how we integrate our own widget at
  [https://widget.koywe.com](https://widget.koywe.com) and clone the
  [Github](https://github.com/koyweforest/koywe-widget-template/)[
  repo](https://github.com/koyweforest/koywe-widget-template/) to start building
  your own project
</Tip>

## BETA: SDK Widget

<Warning>The SDK is currently in Beta and is available only for projects that require a quick solution without the need for enhancements, modifications, or additional support. It will be available for a limited time and will soon be discontinued in favor of API-only integrations.</Warning>

Our SDK is an NPM package, installed in your project. You can configure some
parameters to make it easier for your users and even skip some steps if you
include a [Client ID](/english/documentation/credentials).

Activating the widget will display an overlay where your users will go through
the [Buy Process](/english/about-koywe/what-is-koywe/purchasing-process) and,
coming soon, the [Sales](/english/about-koywe/what-is-koywe/selling-process) on,
without leaving your website or app.

<Warning><b>KYC</b>: If you want to do your own KYC and skip Koywe's process, please contact us. You will need to setup an API endpoint to make
sure your user is identified and provide us with the information.</Warning>

## Installation

Run `npm i @koyweforest/koywe-ramp-sdk` inside your project's folder. You can
also use `yarn`

## Configuration and Use

Using the widget is very simple. For example, showing the ramp at the click of a
button:

```js
import { KoyweRampSDK } from '@koyweforest/koywe-ramp-sdk';
const koywe = new KoyweRampSDK({});
function App() {
  return (
    <Button onClick={() => koywe.show()}>Fund your wallet with Koywe</Button>
  );
}
```

You can add some parameters to make it easier for your users:

#### currencies

A list of currencies that will be offered to the user. By default, all
currencies are shown.

You must pass an array of strings, each value containing the symbol of the
currencies. You can obtain a full list of available fiat currencies at
[https://koywe.com](https://koywe.com)

```js
new KoyweRampSDK({ currencies: ['CLP', 'MXN', 'COP', 'PEN'] });
```

In this example, the user will only be allowed to select CLP, MXN, COP, and PEN.

If you pass an empty array, it will be ignored and default values will be shown.
You can add any string, invalid values will be ignored.

#### tokens

The list of tokens allowed to purchase or sell. By default, all available tokens
for the given currency are shown.

You must pass an array of strings, each value containing the symbol of the
tokens. Multi-chain tokens, such as USDC, should be listed individually
according to the default list. For example, USDC on Polygon should be passed as
"USDC Polygon". You can obtain a full list of available crypto tokens at
[https://koywe.com](https://koywe.com)

```js
new KoyweRampSDK({tokens: ["ETH"]})
```

In this example, only ETH will be available to transact.

If you pasa an empty array, it will be ignored and default values will be shown.
You can add any string, invalid values will be ignored.

<Warning>
  **Important:** Non-existent pairs will be ignored. For example, if there are
  no prices in PEN for the BNB token, when the user selects PEN, the token will
  not be displayed, even if there are prices in other currencies.
</Warning>

#### address

Optional string parameter to setup a wallet address, skipping the step for the
user.

```js
new KoyweRampSDK({ address: '0x402...12' });
```

An invalid or malformed address will be ignored and the user will have to input
a valid one manually.

#### email

String parameter to link a user to the transaction. If it's a valid email, the
widget will trigger an email with an OTP code and ask for it to the user.

```js
new KoyweRampSDK({ email: 'test@koywe.com' });
```

<Warning>
  Providing an email will prevent the user from modifying it and WILL have to
  use the address to buy or sell crypto.
</Warning>

#### callbackUrl

String param containing a valid URL to redirect after paying or navigating
outside the widget.

```js
new KoyweRampSDK({ callbackUrl: 'https://koywe.com......' });
```

<Warning>
  If you don't specify a valid URL, the user will be redirected to Koywe's
  website after finishing the transaction.
</Warning>

#### clientId

Optional parameter containing the
[Client ID](/english/documentation/credentials) to use on the widget. Depending
on the agreement with Koywe, this ID allows access to different payment methods
and conditions.

```js
new KoyweRampSDK({ clientId: '2781......' });
```

If no id is passed, the widget will replicate functionality at https://koywe.com

Checkout our [Credentials](/english/documentation/credentials) sections to learn
more and find out how to get your own ID.

#### testing

Optional boolean parameter to activate testing mode (fake transactions).

```js
new KoyweRampSDK({ testing: true });
```

If parameter is not passed or is passed as false, the widget will point to
production (real money).
