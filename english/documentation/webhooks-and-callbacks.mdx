To make you integration easier, we have enabled ways to alert you when something
happens or to define validation services before executing transactions.

### Webhooks

You can setup a URL to recibe requests every time an event is triggered for a
transaction. possible events are:

- `payment_received`: payment is confirmed

- `payment_rejected`: payment was cancelled or rejected

- `payment_expired`: the transaction expired before receiving payment
  confirmation

- `crypto_tx_sent`: transaction was sent to the blockchain (only on-ramps)

- `crypto_delivered`: transaction confirmed by the blockchain (only on-ramps)

- `crypto_tx_failed`: transaction failed on the blockchain

Additionally, you weill be able to defined a `secret` to validate our requests.
Using this secret, we encrypt the request parameters and add the hash for you to
verify:

```js
const signature = crypto
  .createHmac("sha256", secret)
  .update(JSON.stringify(payload))
  .digest("hex");
```

Example of a request:

```json
{
  "eventName": "crypto_delivered", // event, from the list above
  "orderId": "5a3288ea-0bd4-44d2-af11-aae1f88bbd61", // order id
  "timeStamp": "2022-10-26T22:36:41.658Z",
  "signature": "ed40d34ab7a587cf1a16338a16cc7765ae4420936677482bb33f5f738e4f7189" // hash
}
```

### Authentication Callback

You can setup a URL to your API for us to confirm a user is allowed to operate
in your specific context. Every time a user wants to buy, sell, or check private
information associated to your environment, we will send a request to this URL
before proceeding.

Our platform assumes your API will respond _something_ that looks like a boolean
and supports many authentication methods.

An example using pseudo code:

```js
// user buys crypto
const createOrder (payload) {
    if (!validUser(payload.email)) throw new Error('user not allowed');
    else continue
}
// we check with your API before proceeding
const validUser(email) {
    const payload = { email }
    const headers = { 'Authorization': 'Bearer superJWT' }
    const { data } = await axios.post(urlExternalAPI, payload, { headers })
    reurn data
}
```
