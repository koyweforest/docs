### Technical Documents

Are you ready to integrate Koywe? Great! You've got two options: API or SDK. The easiest way to integrate Koywe is by using our SDK, which will show our interface on anywebsite that has it installed. The disadvantage is that it'll look like Koywe instead of your own site.

The API is a little harder to integrate (we've done our best to make it real easy), but it's flexible enough to be integrated within your flow and app as a white label.
